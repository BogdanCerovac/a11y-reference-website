♫♪ Joyful guitar music ♫♪

A young woman carrying a camera 
is running through a hilly field of rapeseed towards the horizon.
She is wearing a white sleeveless top, jeans shorts, and suspenders.

Fun and flirty cotton materials 
make this boho outfit made of sustainable materials 
a first choice for her next summer musical festival adventure.

The sky is clear with some pinkish clouds from the sunset.
